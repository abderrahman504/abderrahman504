## Hi There! I'm Abdelrahman Khayri 👋

### Who am I?
I'm a computer engineering student at Alexandria University.  
I'm also an ✨*aspiring game developer*✨ and occasionally do some freelancing.  
I read some books, play some games, watch some tv, etc.

### What do I know?
Some good things that have come from the annual eight-month Stress'n'Torture bonanza that is university 🫠🫠 is that I learned a lot of stuff from very different fields I wouldn't otherwise learn about.  
I know some stuff about:
- Databases
- Web Development
- Computer Networks
- Neural Networks
- Computer Architecture

Stuff I'm really into:
- Game Development
- Computer Graphics
- Algorithms
- Software Architecture

### What am I working on these days?
When I'm not fighting off the never-ending barrage of university assignments😮‍💨 you'll find me doing some freelance game development or working on ✨*a personal project*✨ that's very dear to me. Hopefully one day I'll finish it and show it off.

### Where can you find me on that interweb?
You'll find me on twitter (I'm not calling it X, Elon!) [@abdelrahman_kh5](https://x.com/abdelrahman_kh5)   
If you're the kind of person who really only uses Facebook.... No thanks!
