### Who am I?
I'm a computer engineering student at Alexandria University.

I read some books, play some games, watch some tv. Very meandaring.

### What am I working on these days?
When I'm not fighting off the never-ending barrage of university assignmentsüòÆ‚Äçüí® you'll find me doing some freelance game development or working on ‚ú®*a personal project*‚ú® that's very dear to me. Hopefully one day I'll finish it and show it off.

### My presence on the internet

- You'll find me on twitter (I'm not calling it X, Elon!) [@abdelrahman_kh5](https://x.com/abdelrahman_kh5)
